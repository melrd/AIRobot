Easiest way: log in with ssh and see the program output.
Use print("â€¦") to get the information you want.

When you run your code from the menu, an .errlog will collect all output
written to stderr. To use this, you need to tell the print function to
output to stderr:

    import sys

    print("Error message", file=sys.stderr)

use scp or sftp to get access to these files.


Also, you can use bluetooth or wifi to see the output of a mobile robot,
which is not connected via an USB cable.


Another option is to use the LCD display, and put information there.
